# Given the root of a binary tree, split the binary tree into two subtrees by removing one edge such that the product of the sums of the subtrees is maximized.

# Return the maximum product of the sums of the two subtrees. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

# Note that you need to maximize the answer before taking the mod and not after taking it.
