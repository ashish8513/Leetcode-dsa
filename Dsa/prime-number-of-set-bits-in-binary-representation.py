# Given two integers left and right, return the count of numbers in the inclusive range [left, right] having a prime number of set bits in their binary representation.

# Recall that the number of set bits an integer has is the number of 1's present when written in binary.

# For example, 21 written in binary is 10101, which has 3 set bits.


class Solution:
    def countPrimeSetBits(self, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        
        prime_set = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19}
        
        count = 0
        
        for num in range(left, right + 1):
            set_bits = bin(num).count("1")
            
            if set_bits in prime_set:
                count += 1
        
        return count
