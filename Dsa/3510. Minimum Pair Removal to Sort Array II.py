# Given an array nums, you can perform the following operation any number of times:

# Select the adjacent pair with the minimum sum in nums. If multiple such pairs exist, choose the leftmost one.
# Replace the pair with their sum.
# Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the array non-decreasing.

# An array is said to be non-decreasing if each element is greater than or equal to its previous element (if it exists).
