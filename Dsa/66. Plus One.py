# You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

# Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.


class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits):
        n = len(digits)

        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if digits[i] < 9:
                digits[i] += 1
                return digits
            digits[i] = 0

        return [1] + digits
